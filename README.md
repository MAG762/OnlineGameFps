# Online Fps Game on Unity
* An online game on Unity. It consists of two main structures: a server and a client base.
* When creating the game, I focused on mechanics CS:GO

## The server part:
The Photon server and plugin are used for data processing.

Implemented the creation of game sessions and connection to them.

Information and data from the players are synchronized through processing on the server. Example: handling the  damage and player's position.


## The client part:
Two game modes TDM, DM.

Selecting weapons and setting up the character's weapon preset before the match.

Sync and display other players from the server.

You can choose your nickname in the game, and you can connect using the user ID.
